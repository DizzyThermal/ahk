A small console utility is provided in AHK to help see some coordinates and other basic info.
You can invoke this tool from the command line::

    console_spy


Currently, the utility will display the following:

| The current mouse coordinates
| The pixel color (as hex) under the mouse cursor
| The title of the window under the mouse

Use a keyboard interrupt (CTRL+C) to stop the utility.
